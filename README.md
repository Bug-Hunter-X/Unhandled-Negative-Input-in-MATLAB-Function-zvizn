# Unhandled Negative Input in MATLAB Function

This repository demonstrates a common error in MATLAB:  improper handling of negative input values. The function `myFunction.m` is designed to process non-negative inputs, however it does not gracefully handle negative inputs, resulting in an error.  The `bugSolution.m` file provides a corrected version that includes error handling.
